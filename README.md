A Gesture-Based Gaming System for Immersive Gameplay

gameon introduces gaming only via hand gestures, eliminating the need for traditional controllers and shaping the way for a highly interactive gaming experience. 

This project was developed in 40 hours during DevSoc’25, a hackathon organized by Codechef-VIT, where it secured a top 16  position among all participating teams.

Why Traditional Gaming Controllers Fall Short?

1. Physical controllers can be limiting for players with mobility challenges, making gaming less accessible.
2. Current gaming devices require button presses instead of natural hand movements, making gameplay feel less intuitive.
3. Many games require specialized controllers, which adds to the cost and limited accessibility for occasional players.

The Solution:

1. We Implemented advanced hand-tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV, which allowed for real time detection using hand gestures making the experience more intuitive.
2. By using PyAutoGUI, we mapped hand movements to keyboard inputs, allowing players to control games seamlessly.
3. Designed an User-friendly interface ensuring smooth interaction and easy customization for different games.
4. Enhanced Immersion – Transforms gaming into a more natural and engaging experience, redefining how players interact with virtual environments.

In the future, players will be able to create their own gestures, enjoy faster response times, and even use gestures in multiplayer games for a more interactive experience.
